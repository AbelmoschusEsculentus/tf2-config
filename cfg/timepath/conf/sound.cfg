// Good to use '0' if you're not on headphones or if you use a sound card for
// surround sound emulation. Removes some unnecessary dsp effects, as well as
// some sound spatialization features meant for headphones. If you have trouble
// locating sounds after adding this, remove it.
dsp_enhance_stereo		"0"

// Renders fewer sounds and removes some unnecessary ones.
// If you feel like you're not hearing things that you should, set to "0".
dsp_slow_cpu			"1"

// Having the sound run fully asynchronous has been helpful in the past, as it
// seems to (for whatever reason) reduce the number of TDRs experienced during
// gameplay. There's some pretty good information on TDRs (nerds only) here:

snd_async_fullyasync		"1"

// Reduces sampling rate for sound from 44khz to 22khz.
// It will make sounds more squished together and sharper,
// but you might not mind or notice. Give it a shot.
snd_pitchquality		"1"

// Lowend optimization: if nonzero, spatialize only a fraction of sound channels each frame. 1/2^x of channels will be spatialized per frame.
snd_spatialize_roundrobin	"1"

// Changes the size of the audio buffer. Lower = more stuttering. Go as low as you can
snd_mixahead			".07"

// If set to "1" will try to use multicore rendering for sound. However, it may
// produce an annoying delay with sounds being played. If not, use it.
